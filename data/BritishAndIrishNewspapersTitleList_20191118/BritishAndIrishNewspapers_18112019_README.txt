British and Irish Newspapers
 



A title-level list of British, Irish, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies newspapers held by the British Library


Public release, version 1.0, 18 November 2019


Definition: This is a listing of newspapers only, not periodicals or other types of journal. The definition followed by the British Library for a newspaper is a "Serial publication which contains news on current events of special or general interest. The individual parts are listed chronologically or numerically and appear usually at least once a week" (Hana Komonorous, International guidelines for the cataloguing of newspapers, IFLA International Office for UBC, 1989). For seventeenth-century publications, the borderline between newspapers and single issue newsbooks is not always clear. In later years some titles are classified on the Library's catalogue as journals that could be considered newspapers.

Column	Heading	Explanation
A	Title ID	A unique record control number on the British Library catalogue.
B	NID	A unique number assigned to most newspaper titles in the British Library  newspaper collection.
C	NLP	A number assigned to titles which have been digitised or selected for digitisation.
D	Publication title	The title of the newspaper as it appears on the masthead, including definite article. Some early newspapers have records for individual issues on the British Library catalogue, and so are listed individually here. Wherever a newspaper title has changed a separate record has been created for this. For example, there are separate entries for The Daily Universal Register and its successor titles The Times, or, Daily universal register and The Times. 
E	Edition	Where a separate edition statement is recorded on the British Library catalogue.
F	Preceding title	The immediate predecessor  title for a newspaper where it had an earlier title. 
G	Succeeding title	The immediate successor title for a newspaper where it had a subsequent change of title.
H	Place of publication	Town or city of publication. This field has mostly not been used by cataloguing, in favour of Coverage: city.
I	Country of publication	Country of publication. This is the primary source of location information. Other columns provide additional information on place of publication or geographical coding, but none has entries for all titles on this listing. Some early titles were published in Amsterdam but for a London audience: these have been included. Titles with a listed country of publication which match a current British overseas territory have been included, but the list does not include titles from former overseas territories, even if they were partially or entirely published during a British administration. 
J	General area of coverage	Name for geographical coverage taken from the British Library's authority file of newspaper place names. For English or Scottish placenames this contains the most complete county-level information (post 1974 reform but pre 1996 changes). 
K	Coverage: city	Name for geographical coverage taken from the British Library's authority file of newspaper place names. 
L	First geographical subject heading	Library of Congress Subject Heading for geographical coverage.
M	Subsequent geographical subject heading	Library of Congress Subject Heading for geographical coverage.
N	First year held	The first year held by the British Library. For early titles this has been approximated to help with broad analysis. Individual holdings should be checked on field U and explore.bl.uk.
O	Last year held	The last year held by the British Library. For early titles this has been approximated to help with broad analysis. Individual holdings should be checked on field U, and explore.bl.uk.

Q	Publication date two	Last year of publication, where known.
R	Current publication frequency	Where this information is held on the British Library catalogue.

W	Link to British Newspaper Archive	Link to the title on the British Newspaper Archive (BNA). Some titles may be only partially digitised (i.e. not a full run). The information is accurate up to the version of the BNA in August 2019. Subsequent additions to the site will be reflected in later editions of this list.
